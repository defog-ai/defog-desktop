# defog-desktop

This implements a version of defog (complete with agents!) that runs completely on your desktop, and not not require any other dependencies.

- uses `sqlite` as a database
- does not have matplotlib based plotting or user management tools built in, for convenience
- supports agents

To use it, just run install requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, the run `python main.py` and you'll be good to go!
