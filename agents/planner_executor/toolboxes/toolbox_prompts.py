  description: Converting a natural language question into a SQL query, that then runs on an external database. Fetches, filters, aggregates, and performs arithmetic computations on data. Remember that this tool does not have access to the data returned by the previous steps. It only has access to the data in the database.
  inputs: [natural language description of the data required to answer this question (or get the required information for subsequent steps) as a string]

  description: This function generates a line plot using python's seaborn library. It should be used when the user wants to see how a variable changes over time, and should be used immediately after the data_fetcher tool.
  inputs: ["global_dict.<input_df_name>", xaxis column (exactly a single column - often a datetime or string), yaxis column (exactly a single column - always a numerical value), hue column or None, facet column or None, estimator ("mean" if data must be aggregated, "None" if it is not aggregated), individual_id_column or None - refers to the column that contains individual data points, often some kind of id), plot_average_line or None - True if the user wants to plot an average or median line, average_line_type or None - the kind of value for the average line to have. Can be mean, median, max, min, or mode]

-tool_name: t_test
  description: This function gets two groups and runs a t-test to check if there is a significant difference between their means. There are two ways to run the test: paired and unpaired. Paired test has one group column, unpaired has one group column.
  inputs: ["global_dict.<input_df_name>", group column, score column, name column or None, type of t test as a string (paired or unpaired)]
  outputs: pandas df

-tool_name: wilcoxon_test
  description: This function gets two groups and runs a wilcoxon test to check if there is a significant difference between their means.
  inputs: ["global_dict.<input_df_name>", group column, score column, name column]

  inputs: ["global_dict.<input_df_name>", group column, score column]
  outputs: pandas df

- tool_name: fold_change
  description: This function calculates the fold change over time for different groups. Fold change is the ratio of the final value to the initial value.
  inputs: ["global_dict.<input_df_name>", value column (the numerical value), individual id column (the column that represents individual ids to calculate fold change for), time column (the column that represents the time point), group column or None (the column that represents the groups that individuals belong to, like cohort or study)]
